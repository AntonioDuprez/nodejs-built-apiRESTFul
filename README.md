# Build a RESTful Node.js API

This is my first courses of NodeJS about RESTFul

## Part 1 - Hello World

We connected with the server at port 3001 (localhost) and we made a simple Hello World.

## Part 2 - Installing Packages and Create the information

We installing some importants packages. For example, express, body-parser or cors that we will use 

## Part 3 - GET Request

We show all contacts and if there are not contacts we display a error message. Also we filter contacts by id.

## Part 4 - POST, PUT, DELETE Request

When we use POST we received a contact by request and we translate his body and push them into the contacts array. We don't modify the json file.

When we use PUT we modify the contact information filtring by id and we overwrite his information in array contacts.

When we use DELETE we delete the contact from his array (never in json file) and we display a basic information message.
